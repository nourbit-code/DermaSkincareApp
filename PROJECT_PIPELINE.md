# Project Pipeline – DermaSkincareApp

---

## 1. Input
Data enters the system through:
- User interfaces (forms, buttons)
- User actions (create, update, delete)
- System-generated events

The data at this stage is raw.

---

## 2. Validation
Before processing, the system checks:
- Required fields
- Data format and type
- Invalid or missing values

This step prevents errors and incorrect data storage.

---

## 3. Processing
The system applies business logic to the validated data:
- Linking related data
- Updating system state
- Applying conditions and rules

This is where the core logic of the application runs.

---

## 4. Storage
Processed data is saved in persistent storage:
- Database tables
- Structured records identified by unique IDs

This ensures data consistency and future access.

---

## 5. System Logic Layer
The backend handles:
- Requests from the user interface
- Data retrieval and updates
- Coordination between system modules

This layer acts as the brain of the system.

---

## 6. Security & Access Control
The system enforces:
- User authentication
- Role-based access control
- Protection against unauthorized actions

This ensures data safety and controlled access.

---

## 7. Output
The system generates outputs such as:
- Screens and views
- Tables and lists
- Messages and notifications

Outputs are clear and user-friendly.

---

## 8. User Interaction
Users interact with the system through:
- Dashboards
- Navigation controls
- Search and filtering tools

The system responds in real time.

---

## 9. Error Handling
If an error occurs:
- The system shows clear error messages
- The system continues running safely
- User feedback is provided

---

## 10. Maintenance & Improvement
The system supports:
- Bug fixes
- Feature enhancements
- Performance improvements
- Future scalability
